# How to fill a google spreadsheet asynchronously using a form and input fields you have on your webpage markup

I have been trying to figure this out for a while, and after googling away for the last week and a half or so I think I've been able to put the pieces together on how you can successfully and _insecurely_ collect **insensitive** user information from your website page and populate a google spreadsheet.
#### Early warning:
In all honestly it might be way easier to just set up a google form and direct users to the form link and have the form submit the results to a spreadsheet. 
Also tThis should not under any circumstances be treated as an alternative to a proper database.

That being said, I think this is a very easy and highly customizable way to collect data from different sources and have it fill up a spreadsheet and from there the possibilities are endless.
